# location-service

The location service calculates the location of the marker based on angle measurements from two smartphone cameras. The coordinate system origin `(0, 0, 0)^T` is located at the left camera. The right camera must be set up `1m` to the right of the left camera at `(1, 0, 0)^T`. The configuration can be modified by changing the `DISTANCE_BETWEEN_CAMERAS_m` constant in `trig.ts`.

## Installation

__Prerequisites:__

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

1. Install dependencies: `bun install`

## Usage

1. Set `HM_KEY` environment variable to a key phrase. This will be required to connect to the server.
2. Set the `BUN_PORT` environment variable to a port of your choosing. Defaults to `3000`.
3. Run the server using `bun run .`.
4. Navigate to the server's hostname and port in your browser.

__Warning:__ Many modern browsers require an encrypted (`HTTPS`, `SSL/TLS`) connection to access the camera feed. You'll need to run this program on a server with a globally valid certificate or create your own and manually install it on the devices that you intend to use as cameras. An exception is usually made for `localhost`, which at least makes testing easier.

## Tests

Tests can be run using `bun test`.
